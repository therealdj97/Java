JDBC Database Driver :-
	It is a s/w component that is used to facilitate communication between Java Application and DBMS.

Types Of JDBC Drivers :- 

1) Type-I	: JDBC-ODBC Driver Bridge. lack of performance		

2) Type-II	: Partly written in java and partly in native code.

3) Type-III	: Network protocol drivers. middleware server

4) Type-IV	: Vendor Protocol drivers. fully written in java. developed by DBMS vendors themselves.
	

7 steps to be followed in a JDBC program :- 

1) load the database Driver.

2) get Connection with the database.

3) create Statement to execute query. 

4) execute the query. 

5) store result of the query into ResultSet 

6) process data from the ResultSet.

7) close the database Connection. 

	
4 interfaces : 
	1) java.sql.Driver
	2) java.sql.Connection
	3) java.sql.Statement
	4) java.sql.ResultSet

	implementing classes of above interfaces are provided by JDBC Drivers. 	


Calling stored procedure in jdbc :- 

			CallableStatement cs = con.prepareCall(
					"{call stored_proc_name(?,?)}");
			
			cs.setInt(1,123);
			
			cs.registerOutParameter(2, Types.CHAR);
			
			cs.execute();
			
			String result = cs.getString(2);
