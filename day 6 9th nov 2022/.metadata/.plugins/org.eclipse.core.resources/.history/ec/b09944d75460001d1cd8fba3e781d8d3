//5. Create a class called Circle which contains:
//• Two private instance variables: radius (type double) and color (type String).
//• Two overloaded constructors: a default constructor with no argument which
//initializes the instance variables with the value of 1.0 and red respectively and
//a constructor which takes a double argument for radius and String argument for color.
//• Two public methods: getRadius() and getArea(), which return the radius and area of
//the instance, respectively.
//
//Create two objects for the class using two constructors and invoke the methods.
